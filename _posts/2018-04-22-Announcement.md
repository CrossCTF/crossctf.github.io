CrossCTF is a competition between schools. It is designed to foster healthy competition between the various educational instutions in Singapore. Traditionally, a Champion’s Trophy has and will continue to be passed to the winning schools  of the year.

In the light of the above, we have to make clear the constraint that the members in a team have to be currently in the same school to adequately represent their institution.

This clarification of the rule will affect teams who are recent graduates of their schools and are no longer holding valid matriculation cards. Letters of acceptance/placing for future admittance will no longer be accepted.

1. we would like to clarify that there will be a minimum number of team members of 1 and maximum number of team members of 3. So anybody who can't form a team of 3 can still play in the qualifiers and finals.


2. since this is a inter-varsity competition where teams will be representing their schools, we decided to ensure that all teams are only from ONE school. All teams with more than 1 school will contacted individually.


3. after the qualifiers, teams who will be moving on to the final round will have to provide proof of admittance of their respective school. Failure to do so will result in disqualification and the right to move on to the final round will be passed to the next eligible team.
