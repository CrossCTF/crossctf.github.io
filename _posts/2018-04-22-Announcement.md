1. we would like to clarify that there will be a minimum number of team members of 1 and maximum number of team members of 3. So anybody who can't form a team of 3 can still play in the qualifiers and finals.


2. since this is a inter-varsity competition where teams will be representing their schools, we decided to ensure that all teams are only from ONE school. All teams with more than 1 school will contacted individually.


3. after the qualifiers, teams who will be moving on to the final round will have to provide proof of admittance of their respective school. Failure to do so will result in disqualification and the right to move on to the final round will be passed to the next eligible team.


MORE TO COME
