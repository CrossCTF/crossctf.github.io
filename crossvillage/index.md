	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Description:</td>
		<td>End-to-end encryption, or E2EE in short, involves encrypting data on the mobile application before it gets sent to the application server. This is mainly to prevent any attackers to tamper or inject malicious payloads while the data is in transit, in the event of a man-in-the-middle attack. However, that does not mean that the application server is safe from such attacks even if E2EE is implemented.</td>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Company:</td>
		<td>N/A</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Description:</td>
		<td>Physical locks are an important aspect of operations security that is often overlooked. In order to properly assess the amount of security a particular lock would provide, it would be helpful to learn its mechanism and the tried and tested methods of defeating them. (Or, you know, just just pick up the skill for fun)</td>

Does the mobile app only offer the features that are stated upfront or are there any hidden "features" that the users (us) do not know about?</td>
