	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" >Description:</td>
		<td>End-to-end encryption, or E2EE in short, involves encrypting data on the mobile application before it gets sent to the application server. This is mainly to prevent any attackers to tamper or inject malicious payloads while the data is in transit, in the event of a man-in-the-middle attack. However, that does not mean that the application server is safe from such attacks even if E2EE is implemented.</td>

### Talk 2: Introduction to Lockpicking

		<td>Speaker Name:<br/><br/></td>
		<td valign="top" >Fazli Sapuan</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" >Speaker Bio:</td>
		<td>Locksmiths hate him. Check out this one weird trick he once saw someone on YouTube use to defeat a lock 9 out of 10 experts thought was adequately secure.<br/><br/></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" >Company:</td>
		<td>N/A<br/><br/></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" >Description:</td>
		<td>Physical locks are an important aspect of operations security that is often overlooked. In order to properly assess the amount of security a particular lock would provide, it would be helpful to learn its mechanism and the tried and tested methods of defeating them. (Or, you know, just just pick up the skill for fun)</td>

		<td>This year marks the 10 years in which Apple App Store and Google Play Store have been in business. Downloading, installing and using of mobile applications from these stores have become an integral part of our daily interactions with our mobile devices. However, do the users (us) really know what these mobile app offered us? Does the mobile app only offer the features that are stated upfront or are there any hidden "features" that the users (us) do not know about?</td>
